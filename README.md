# Proyecto Big Data - **Analysis of Traffic at San Francisco International Airsport**
  This project is the final project of the Big Data course at Tokio School. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset on traffic at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), utilizing various Big Data tools and approaches.

## TOOLS USED
  - **Google Colab**: For developing and running Python code.
  - **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
  - **Cassandra**: **NoSQL** database used for efficient management and storage of large volumes of data.
  - **Power BI**: For visualizing results and creating the interactive presentation.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
  This repository is organized into three main folders:

### 1. **Code**
  Contains the source code used in the project:

  - **Google Colab**: Python code file for data analysis.
  
  - **Cassandra**: A notes file with the necessary code to work with the Cassandra database.

### 2. **Data**
  Contains the dataset in **CSV** format with information on traffic at San Francisco International Airport used for analysis.

### 3. **Docs**
  Contains important documents related to the project:

- **Report**: A detailed document on the project's development, with the following index:
  - **1. DEVELOPMENT**:
    - 1.1 Categorize by data type and structure.
    - 1.2 Cassandra.
    - 1.3 PySpark DataFrame.
    - 1.4 Descriptive analysis, correlation matrix, and logarithm:
    - 1.4.1 Descriptive analysis.
    - 1.4.2 Correlation analysis.
    - 1.4.3 Algorithm: Decision tree.
**2. CONCLUSIONS**.

  **Technical file**: Technical description of the methods and processes used in the project.
  
  **Presentation**: Visual presentation created with **Power BI**, summarizing the findings and results of the analysis.

## PROJECT OBJETIVE
  The project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of air traffic data, explore patterns in the information, and present conclusions based on descriptive analysis, correlation matrix, and the use of machine learning algorithms (such as the Decision Tree). It also      seeks to demonstrate how large volumes of data can be managed and analyzed using Big Data tools and how results can be presented visually using Power BI.
